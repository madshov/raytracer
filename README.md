# raytracer
This is a simple app for doing backwards ray tracing of objects on a given canvas. Currently only spheres are rendered. Each sphere is defined by a radius and center coordinates, and with a given color, and a few other properties like transparency and reflection. Each ray is traced 5 times using a recursive strategy, before tracing it to the light source.
